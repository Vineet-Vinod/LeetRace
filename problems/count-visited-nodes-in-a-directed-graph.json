  "description": "There is a directed graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n directed edges.\nYou are given a 0-indexed array edges where edges[i] indicates that there is an edge from node i to node edges[i].\nConsider the following process on the graph:\n\nYou start from a node x and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this same process.\n\nReturn an array answer where answer[i] is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node i.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: edges = [1,2,0,0]\nOutput: [3,3,3,4]\nExplanation: We perform the process starting from each node in the following way:\n- Starting from node 0, we visit the nodes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.\n- Starting from node 1, we visit the nodes 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.\n- Starting from node 2, we visit the nodes 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.\n- Starting from node 3, we visit the nodes 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: edges = [1,2,3,4,0]\nOutput: [5,5,5,5,5]\nExplanation: Starting from any node we can visit every node in the graph in the process.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == edges.length\n2 <= n <= 105\n0 <= edges[i] <= n - 1\nedges[i] != i\n\n",

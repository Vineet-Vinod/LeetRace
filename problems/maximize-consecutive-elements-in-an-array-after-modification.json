  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.\nInitially, you can increase the value of any element in the array by at most 1.\nAfter that, you need to select one or more elements from the final array such that those elements are consecutive when sorted in increasing order. For example, the elements [3, 4, 5] are consecutive while [3, 4, 6] and [1, 1, 2, 3] are not.\nReturn the maximum number of elements that you can select.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,5,1,1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can increase the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,1,5,2,1].\nWe select the elements [3,1,5,2,1] and we sort them to obtain [1,2,3], which are consecutive.\nIt can be shown that we cannot select more than 3 consecutive elements.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,4,7,10]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The maximum consecutive elements that we can select is 1.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 106\n\n",

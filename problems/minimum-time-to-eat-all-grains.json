  "description": "There are n hens and m grains on a line. You are given the initial positions of the hens and the grains in two integer arrays hens and grains of size n and m respectively.\nAny hen can eat a grain if they are on the same position. The time taken for this is negligible. One hen can also eat multiple grains.\nIn 1 second, a hen can move right or left by 1 unit. The hens can move simultaneously and independently of each other.\nReturn the minimum time to eat all grains if the hens act optimally.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: hens = [3,6,7], grains = [2,4,7,9]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nOne of the ways hens eat all grains in 2 seconds is described below:\n- The first hen eats the grain at position 2 in 1 second. \n- The second hen eats the grain at position 4 in 2 seconds. \n- The third hen eats the grains at positions 7 and 9 in 2 seconds. \nSo, the maximum time needed is 2.\nIt can be proven that the hens cannot eat all grains before 2 seconds.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: hens = [4,6,109,111,213,215], grains = [5,110,214]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nOne of the ways hens eat all grains in 1 second is described below:\n- The first hen eats the grain at position 5 in 1 second. \n- The fourth hen eats the grain at position 110 in 1 second.\n- The sixth hen eats the grain at position 214 in 1 second. \n- The other hens do not move. \nSo, the maximum time needed is 1.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= hens.length, grains.length <= 2*104\n0 <= hens[i], grains[j] <= 109\n\n",

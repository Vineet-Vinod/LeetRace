  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length and there is also an empty array arr. Alice and Bob decided to play a game where in every round Alice and Bob will do one move. The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nEvery round, first Alice will remove the minimum element from nums, and then Bob does the same.\nNow, first Bob will append the removed element in the array arr, and then Alice does the same.\nThe game continues until nums becomes empty.\n\nReturn the resulting array arr.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [5,4,2,3]\nOutput: [3,2,5,4]\nExplanation: In round one, first Alice removes 2 and then Bob removes 3. Then in arr firstly Bob appends 3 and then Alice appends 2. So arr = [3,2].\nAt the begining of round two, nums = [5,4]. Now, first Alice removes 4 and then Bob removes 5. Then both append in arr which becomes [3,2,5,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,5]\nOutput: [5,2]\nExplanation: In round one, first Alice removes 2 and then Bob removes 5. Then in arr firstly Bob appends and then Alice appends. So arr = [5,2].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 100\nnums.length % 2 == 0\n\n",

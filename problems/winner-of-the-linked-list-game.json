  "description": "You are given the head of a linked list of even length containing integers.\nEach odd-indexed node contains an odd integer and each even-indexed node contains an even integer.\nWe call each even-indexed node and its next node a pair, e.g., the nodes with indices 0 and 1 are a pair, the nodes with indices 2 and 3 are a pair, and so on.\nFor every pair, we compare the values of the nodes in the pair:\n\nIf the odd-indexed node is higher, the \"Odd\" team gets a point.\nIf the even-indexed node is higher, the \"Even\" team gets a point.\n\nReturn the name of the team with the higher points, if the points are equal, return \"Tie\".\n\u00a0\nExample 1: \n\nInput:   head = [2,1] \nOutput:   \"Even\" \nExplanation:  There is only one pair in this linked list and that is (2,1). Since 2 > 1, the Even team gets the point.\nHence, the answer would be \"Even\".\n\nExample 2: \n\nInput:   head = [2,5,4,7,20,5] \nOutput:   \"Odd\" \nExplanation:  There are 3 pairs in this linked list. Let's investigate each pair individually:\n(2,5) -> Since 2 < 5, The Odd team gets the point.\n(4,7) -> Since 4 < 7, The Odd team gets the point.\n(20,5) -> Since 20 > 5, The Even team gets the point.\nThe Odd team earned 2 points while the Even team got 1 point and the Odd team has the higher points.\nHence, the answer would be \"Odd\".\n\nExample 3: \n\nInput:   head = [4,5,2,1] \nOutput:   \"Tie\" \nExplanation:  There are 2 pairs in this linked list. Let's investigate each pair individually:\n(4,5) -> Since 4 < 5, the Odd team gets the point.\n(2,1) -> Since 2 > 1, the Even team gets the point.\nBoth teams earned 1 point.\nHence, the answer would be \"Tie\".\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [2, 100].\nThe number of nodes in the list is even.\n1 <= Node.val <= 100\nThe value of each odd-indexed node is odd.\nThe value of each even-indexed node is even.\n\n",

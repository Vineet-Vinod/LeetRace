  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes, p and q. If either node p or q does not exist in the tree, return null. All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: \"The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)\". A descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from node x to some leaf node.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition of LCA.\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10\nOutput: null\nExplanation: Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-109 <= Node.val <= 109\nAll Node.val are unique.\np != q\n\n\u00a0\nFollow up:\u00a0Can you find the LCA traversing the tree, without checking nodes existence?",

  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array nums of integers.\nA triplet of indices (i, j, k) is a mountain if:\n\ni < j < k\nnums[i] < nums[j] and nums[k] < nums[j]\n\nReturn the minimum possible sum of a mountain triplet of nums. If no such triplet exists, return -1.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,6,1,5,3]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Triplet (2, 3, 4) is a mountain triplet of sum 9 since: \n- 2 < 3 < 4\n- nums[2] < nums[3] and nums[4] < nums[3]\nAnd the sum of this triplet is nums[2] + nums[3] + nums[4] = 9. It can be shown that there are no mountain triplets with a sum of less than 9.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,4,8,7,10,2]\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: Triplet (1, 3, 5) is a mountain triplet of sum 13 since: \n- 1 < 3 < 5\n- nums[1] < nums[3] and nums[5] < nums[3]\nAnd the sum of this triplet is nums[1] + nums[3] + nums[5] = 13. It can be shown that there are no mountain triplets with a sum of less than 13.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [6,5,4,3,4,5]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It can be shown that there are no mountain triplets in nums.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= nums.length <= 50\n1 <= nums[i] <= 50\n\n",

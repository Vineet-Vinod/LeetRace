  "description": "Given the 0-indexed arrays prices and profits of length n. There are n items in an store where the ith item has a price of prices[i] and a profit of profits[i].\nWe have to pick three items with the following condition:\n\nprices[i] < prices[j] < prices[k] where i < j < k.\n\nIf we pick items with indices i, j and k satisfying the above condition, the profit would be profits[i] + profits[j] + profits[k].\nReturn the maximum profit we can get, and -1 if it's not possible to pick three items with the given condition.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [10,2,3,4], profits = [100,2,7,10]\nOutput: 19\nExplanation: We can't pick the item with index i=0 since there are no indices j and k such that the condition holds.\nSo the only triplet we can pick, are the items with indices 1, 2 and 3 and it's a valid pick since prices[1] < prices[2] < prices[3].\nThe answer would be sum of their profits which is 2 + 7 + 10 = 19.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [1,2,3,4,5], profits = [1,5,3,4,6]\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: We can select any triplet of items since for each triplet of indices i, j and k such that i < j < k, the condition holds.\nTherefore the maximum profit we can get would be the 3 most profitable items which are indices 1, 3 and 4.\nThe answer would be sum of their profits which is 5 + 4 + 6 = 15.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: prices = [4,3,2,1], profits = [33,20,19,87]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: We can't select any triplet of indices such that the condition holds, so we return -1.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= prices.length == profits.length <= 50000\n1 <= prices[i] <= 5000\n1 <= profits[i] <= 106\n\n",

  "description": "Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.\nGiven a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:\n\nEach substring is balanced.\n\nReturn the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"RLRRLLRLRL\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: s can be split into \"RL\", \"RRLL\", \"RL\", \"RL\", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"RLRRRLLRLL\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: s can be split into \"RL\", \"RRRLLRLL\", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.\nNote that s cannot be split into \"RL\", \"RR\", \"RL\", \"LR\", \"LL\", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"LLLLRRRR\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: s can be split into \"LLLLRRRR\".\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= s.length <= 1000\ns[i] is either 'L' or 'R'.\ns is a balanced string.\n\n",

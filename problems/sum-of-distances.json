  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. There exists an array arr of length nums.length, where arr[i] is the sum of |i - j| over all j such that nums[j] == nums[i] and j != i. If there is no such j, set arr[i] to be 0.\nReturn the array arr.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,1,1,2]\nOutput: [5,0,3,4,0]\nExplanation: \nWhen i = 0, nums[0] == nums[2] and nums[0] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[0] = |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5. \nWhen i = 1, arr[1] = 0 because there is no other index with value 3.\nWhen i = 2, nums[2] == nums[0] and nums[2] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[2] = |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3. \nWhen i = 3, nums[3] == nums[0] and nums[3] == nums[2]. Therefore, arr[3] = |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4. \nWhen i = 4, arr[4] = 0 because there is no other index with value 2. \n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0,5,3]\nOutput: [0,0,0]\nExplanation: Since each element in nums is distinct, arr[i] = 0 for all i.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n\u00a0\nNote: This question is the same as  2121: Intervals Between Identical Elements.\n",

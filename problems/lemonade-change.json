  "description": "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.\nNote that you do not have any change in hand at first.\nGiven an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nFrom the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.\nFrom the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.\nFrom the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\nSince all customers got correct change, we output true.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: \nFrom the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.\nFor the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.\nFor the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.\nSince not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= bills.length <= 105\nbills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.\n\n",

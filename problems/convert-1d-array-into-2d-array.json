  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.\nThe elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.\nReturn an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2\nOutput: [[1,2],[3,4]]\nExplanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.\nThe first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.\nThe second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3\nOutput: [[1,2,3]]\nExplanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.\nPut all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There are 2 elements in original.\nIt is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= original.length <= 5 * 104\n1 <= original[i] <= 105\n1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104\n\n",

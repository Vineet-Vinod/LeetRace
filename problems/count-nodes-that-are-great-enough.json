  "description": "You are given a root to a binary tree and an integer k. A node of this tree is called great enough if the followings hold:\n\nIts subtree has at least k nodes.\nIts value is greater than the value of at least k nodes in its subtree.\n\nReturn the number of nodes in this tree that are great enough.\nThe node u is in the subtree of the node\u00a0v, if u == v\u00a0or\u00a0v\u00a0is an\u00a0ancestor of u.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], k = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Number the nodes from 1 to 7.\nThe values in the subtree of node 1: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. Since node.val == 7, there are 6 nodes having a smaller value than its value. So it's great enough.\nThe values in the subtree of node 2: {3,4,6}. Since node.val == 6, there are 2 nodes having a smaller value than its value. So it's great enough.\nThe values in the subtree of node 3: {1,2,5}. Since node.val == 5, there are 2 nodes having a smaller value than its value. So it's great enough.\nIt can be shown that other nodes are not great enough.\nSee the picture below for a better understanding.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3], k = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Number the nodes from 1 to 3.\nThe values in the subtree of node 1: {1,2,3}. Since node.val == 1, there are no nodes having a smaller value than its value. So it's not great enough.\nThe values in the subtree of node 2: {2}. Since node.val == 2, there are no nodes having a smaller value than its value. So it's not great enough.\nThe values in the subtree of node 3: {3}. Since node.val == 3, there are no nodes having a smaller value than its value. So it's not great enough.\nSee the picture below for a better understanding.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [3,2,2], k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Number the nodes from 1 to 3.\nThe values in the subtree of node 1: {2,2,3}. Since node.val == 3, there are 2 nodes having a smaller value than its value. So it's great enough.\nThe values in the subtree of node 2: {2}.

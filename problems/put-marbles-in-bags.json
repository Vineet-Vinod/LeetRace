  "description": "You have k bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. You are also given the integer k.\nDivide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:\n\nNo bag is empty.\nIf the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.\nIf a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].\n\nThe score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.\nReturn the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: \nThe distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. \nThe distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. \nThus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: weights = [1, 3], k = 2\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. \nSince both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= weights.length <= 105\n1 <= weights[i] <= 109\n\n",

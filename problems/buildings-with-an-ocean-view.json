  "description": "There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.\nThe ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.\nReturn a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: heights = [4,2,3,1]\nOutput: [0,2,3]\nExplanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: heights = [4,3,2,1]\nOutput: [0,1,2,3]\nExplanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: heights = [1,3,2,4]\nOutput: [3]\nExplanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= heights.length <= 105\n1 <= heights[i] <= 109\n\n",

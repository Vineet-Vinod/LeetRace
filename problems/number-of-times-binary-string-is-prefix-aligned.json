  "description": "You have a 1-indexed binary string of length n where all the bits are 0 initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from 0 to 1) one by one. You are given a 1-indexed integer array flips where flips[i] indicates that the bit at index i will be flipped in the ith step.\nA binary string is prefix-aligned if, after the ith step, all the bits in the inclusive range [1, i] are ones and all the other bits are zeros.\nReturn the number of times the binary string is prefix-aligned during the flipping process.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: flips = [3,2,4,1,5]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The binary string is initially \"00000\".\nAfter applying step 1: The string becomes \"00100\", which is not prefix-aligned.\nAfter applying step 2: The string becomes \"01100\", which is not prefix-aligned.\nAfter applying step 3: The string becomes \"01110\", which is not prefix-aligned.\nAfter applying step 4: The string becomes \"11110\", which is prefix-aligned.\nAfter applying step 5: The string becomes \"11111\", which is prefix-aligned.\nWe can see that the string was prefix-aligned 2 times, so we return 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: flips = [4,1,2,3]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The binary string is initially \"0000\".\nAfter applying step 1: The string becomes \"0001\", which is not prefix-aligned.\nAfter applying step 2: The string becomes \"1001\", which is not prefix-aligned.\nAfter applying step 3: The string becomes \"1101\", which is not prefix-aligned.\nAfter applying step 4: The string becomes \"1111\", which is prefix-aligned.\nWe can see that the string was prefix-aligned 1 time, so we return 1.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == flips.length\n1 <= n <= 5 * 104\nflips is a permutation of the integers in the range [1, n].\n\n",

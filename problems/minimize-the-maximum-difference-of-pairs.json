  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer p. Find p pairs of indices of nums such that the maximum difference amongst all the pairs is minimized. Also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the p pairs.\nNote that for a pair of elements at the index i and j, the difference of this pair is |nums[i] - nums[j]|, where |x| represents the absolute value of x.\nReturn the minimum maximum difference among all p pairs. We define the maximum of an empty set to be zero.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [10,1,2,7,1,3], p = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The first pair is formed from the indices 1 and 4, and the second pair is formed from the indices 2 and 5. \nThe maximum difference is max(|nums[1] - nums[4]|, |nums[2] - nums[5]|) = max(0, 1) = 1. Therefore, we return 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,2,1,2], p = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Let the indices 1 and 3 form a pair. The difference of that pair is |2 - 2| = 0, which is the minimum we can attain.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n0 <= p <= (nums.length)/2\n\n",

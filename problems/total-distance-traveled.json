  "description": "A truck has two fuel tanks. You are given two integers, mainTank representing the fuel present in the main tank in liters and additionalTank representing the fuel present in the additional tank in liters.\nThe truck has a mileage of 10 km per liter. Whenever 5 liters of fuel get\u00a0used up in the main tank,\u00a0if the additional tank has at least 1 liters of fuel, 1 liters of fuel will be transferred from the additional tank to the main tank.\nReturn the maximum distance which can be traveled.\nNote: Injection from the additional tank is not continuous. It happens suddenly and immediately for every 5 liters consumed.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: mainTank = 5, additionalTank = 10\nOutput: 60\nExplanation: \nAfter spending 5 litre of fuel, fuel remaining is (5 - 5 + 1) = 1 litre and distance traveled is 50km.\nAfter spending another 1 litre of fuel, no fuel gets injected in the main tank and the main tank becomes empty.\nTotal distance traveled is 60km.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mainTank = 1, additionalTank = 2\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: \nAfter spending 1 litre of fuel, the main tank becomes empty.\nTotal distance traveled is 10km.\n\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= mainTank, additionalTank <= 100\n\n",

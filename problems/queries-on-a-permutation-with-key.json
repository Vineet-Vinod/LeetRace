  "description": "Given the array queries of positive integers between 1 and m, you have to process all queries[i] (from i=0 to i=queries.length-1) according to the following rules:\n\nIn the beginning, you have the permutation P=[1,2,3,...,m].\nFor the current i, find the position of queries[i] in the permutation P (indexing from 0) and then move this at the beginning of the permutation P. Notice that the position of queries[i] in P is the result for queries[i].\n\nReturn an array containing the result for the given queries.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5\nOutput: [2,1,2,1] \nExplanation: The queries are processed as follow: \nFor i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. \nFor i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. \nFor i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. \nFor i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5]. \nTherefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].  \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: queries = [4,1,2,2], m = 4\nOutput: [3,1,2,0]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: queries = [7,5,5,8,3], m = 8\nOutput: [6,5,0,7,5]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= m <= 10^3\n1 <= queries.length <= m\n1 <= queries[i] <= m\n\n",

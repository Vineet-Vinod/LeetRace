  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums and a positive integer limit.\nIn one operation, you can choose any two indices i and j and swap nums[i] and nums[j] if |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit.\nReturn the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.\nAn array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if in the first position where a and b differ, array a has an element that is less than the corresponding element in b. For example, the array [2,10,3] is lexicographically smaller than the array [10,2,3] because they differ at index 0 and 2 < 10.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2\nOutput: [1,3,5,8,9]\nExplanation: Apply the operation 2 times:\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]\nWe cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.\nNote that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3\nOutput: [1,6,7,18,1,2]\nExplanation: Apply the operation 3 times:\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]\nWe cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3\nOutput: [1,7,28,19,10]\nExplanation: [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 109\n1 <= limit <= 109\n\n",

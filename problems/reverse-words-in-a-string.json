  "description": "Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.\nA word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.\nReturn a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.\nNote that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"the sky is blue\"\nOutput: \"blue is sky the\"\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"  hello world  \"\nOutput: \"world hello\"\nExplanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"a good   example\"\nOutput: \"example good a\"\nExplanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 104\ns contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.\nThere is at least one word in s.\n\n\u00a0\nFollow-up:\u00a0If the string data type is mutable in your language, can\u00a0you solve it\u00a0in-place\u00a0with\u00a0O(1)\u00a0extra space?\n",

  "description": "You are given an array nums which is a permutation of [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]. The score of any permutation of [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1] named perm is defined as:\nscore(perm) = |perm[0] - nums[perm[1]]| + |perm[1] - nums[perm[2]]| + ... + |perm[n - 1] - nums[perm[0]]|\nReturn the permutation perm which has the minimum possible score. If multiple permutations exist with this score, return the one that is lexicographically smallest among them.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,0,2]\nOutput: [0,1,2]\nExplanation:\n\nThe lexicographically smallest permutation with minimum cost is [0,1,2]. The cost of this permutation is |0 - 0| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0,2,1]\nOutput: [0,2,1]\nExplanation:\n\nThe lexicographically smallest permutation with minimum cost is [0,2,1]. The cost of this permutation is |0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n == nums.length <= 14\nnums is a permutation of [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1].\n\n",

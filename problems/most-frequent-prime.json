  "description": "You are given a m x n 0-indexed 2D matrix mat. From every cell, you can create numbers in the following way:\n\nThere could be at most 8 paths from the cells namely: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east.\nSelect a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.\nNote that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are 1, 9, 1, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: 1, 19, 191.\n\nReturn the most frequent prime number greater than 10 out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or -1 if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the largest among them.\nNote: It is invalid to change the direction during the move.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n \n\n\nInput: mat = [[1,1],[9,9],[1,1]]\nOutput: 19\nExplanation: \nFrom cell (0,0) there are 3 possible directions and the numbers greater than 10 which can be created in those directions are:\nEast: [11], South-East: [19], South: [19,191].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [19,191,19,11].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [99,91,91,91,91].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [91,91,99,91,91].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [11,19,191,19].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [11,19,19,191].\nThe most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 19.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mat = [[7]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: The only number which can be formed is 7. It is a prime number however it is not greater than 10, so return -1.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: mat = [[9,7,8],[4,6,5],[2,8,6]]\nOutput: 97\nExplanation: \nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,0) in all possible directions are: [97,978,96,966,94,942].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [78,75,76,768,74,79].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,2) in all possible directions are: [85,856,86,862,87,879].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,0) in all possible directions are: [46,465,48,42,49,47].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,1) in all possible directions are: [65,66,68,62,64,69,67,68].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (1,2) in all possible directions are: [56,58,56,564,57,58].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,0) in all possible directions are: [28,286,24,249,26,268].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,1) in all possible directions are: [86,82,84,86,867,85].\nNumbers greater than 10 created from the cell (2,2) in all possible directions are: [68,682,66,669,65,658].\nThe most frequent prime number among all the created numbers is 97.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nm == mat.length\nn == mat[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 6\n1 <= mat[i][j] <= 9\n\n",

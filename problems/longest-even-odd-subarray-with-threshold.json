  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer threshold.\nFind the length of the longest subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at index r (0 <= l <= r < nums.length) that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nnums[l] % 2 == 0\nFor all indices i in the range [l, r - 1], nums[i] % 2 != nums[i + 1] % 2\nFor all indices i in the range [l, r], nums[i] <= threshold\n\nReturn an integer denoting the length of the longest such subarray.\nNote: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,5,4], threshold = 5\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 1 and ends at r = 3 => [2,5,4]. This subarray satisfies the conditions.\nHence, the answer is the length of the subarray, 3. We can show that 3 is the maximum possible achievable length.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2], threshold = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 1 and ends at r = 1 => [2]. \nIt satisfies all the conditions and we can show that 1 is the maximum possible achievable length.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [2,3,4,5], threshold = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: In this example, we can select the subarray that starts at l = 0 and ends at r = 2 => [2,3,4]. \nIt satisfies all the conditions.\nHence, the answer is the length of the subarray, 3. We can show that 3 is the maximum possible achievable length.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100 \n1 <= nums[i] <= 100 \n1 <= threshold <= 100\n\n",

If there is no outgoing edge from node i, then edges[i] == -1.\nReturn the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.\nA cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: edges = [3,3,4,2,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The longest cycle in the graph is the cycle: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.\nThe length of this cycle is 3, so 3 is returned.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: edges = [2,-1,3,1]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There are no cycles in this graph.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == edges.length\n2 <= n <= 105\n-1 <= edges[i] < n\nedges[i] != i\n\n",

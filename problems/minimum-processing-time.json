Each task must be assigned to a unique core, and each core can only be used once.\nYou are given an array processorTime representing the time each processor becomes available and an array tasks representing how long each task takes to complete. Return the\u00a0minimum time needed to complete all tasks.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: processorTime = [8,10], tasks = [2,2,3,1,8,7,4,5]\nOutput: 16\nExplanation:\nAssign the tasks at indices 4, 5, 6, 7 to the first processor which becomes available at time = 8, and the tasks at indices 0, 1, 2, 3 to the second processor which becomes available at time = 10.\u00a0\nThe time taken by the first processor to finish the execution of all tasks is\u00a0max(8 + 8, 8 + 7, 8 + 4, 8 + 5) = 16.\nThe time taken by the second processor to finish the execution of all tasks is\u00a0max(10 + 2, 10 + 2, 10 + 3, 10 + 1) = 13.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: processorTime = [10,20], tasks = [2,3,1,2,5,8,4,3]\nOutput: 23\nExplanation:\nAssign the tasks at indices 1, 4, 5, 6 to the first processor and the others to the second processor.\nThe time taken by the first processor to finish the execution of all tasks is max(10 + 3, 10 + 5, 10 + 8, 10 + 4) = 18.\nThe time taken by the second processor to finish the execution of all tasks is max(20 + 2, 20 + 1, 20 + 2, 20 + 3) = 23.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == processorTime.length <= 25000\n1 <= tasks.length <= 105\n0 <= processorTime[i] <= 109\n1 <= tasks[i] <= 109\ntasks.length == 4 * n\n\n",

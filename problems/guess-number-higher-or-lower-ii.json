  "description": "We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:\n\nI pick a number between\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a0n.\nYou guess a number.\nIf you guess the right number, you win the game.\nIf you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.\nEvery time you guess a wrong number\u00a0x, you will pay\u00a0x\u00a0dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.\n\nGiven a particular\u00a0n, return\u00a0the minimum amount of money you need to\u00a0guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: The winning strategy is as follows:\n- The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.\n\u00a0   - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.\n\u00a0   - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.\n\u00a0       - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.\n\u00a0       - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n\u00a0       - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n\u00a0   - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.\n\u00a0       - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.\n\u00a0       - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.\n\u00a0           - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.\n\u00a0           - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n\u00a0           - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n\u00a0       - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.\n\u00a0           - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n\u00a0           - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.\nThe worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\u00a0There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\u00a0There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.\n- Guess 1.\n\u00a0   - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n\u00a0   - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.\nThe worst case is that you pay $1.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 200\n\n",

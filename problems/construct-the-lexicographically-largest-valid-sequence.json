  "description": "Given an integer n, find a sequence with elements in the range [1, n] that satisfies all of the following:\n\nThe integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.\nEach integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.\nFor every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.\n\nThe distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.\nReturn the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution. \nA sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: [3,1,2,3,2]\nExplanation: [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5\nOutput: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 20\n\n",

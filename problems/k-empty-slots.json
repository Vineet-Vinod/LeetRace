We turn on exactly one bulb every day until all bulbs are on after n days.\nYou are given an array bulbs\u00a0of length n\u00a0where bulbs[i] = x means that on the (i+1)th day, we will turn on the bulb at position x\u00a0where\u00a0i\u00a0is\u00a00-indexed\u00a0and\u00a0x\u00a0is\u00a01-indexed.\nGiven an integer k, return\u00a0the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs that have exactly\u00a0k bulbs between them that are all turned off.

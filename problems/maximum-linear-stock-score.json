  "description": "Given a 1-indexed integer array prices, where prices[i] is the price of a particular stock on the ith day, your task is to select some of the elements of prices such that your selection is linear.\nA selection indexes, where indexes is a 1-indexed integer array of length k which is a subsequence of the array [1, 2, ..., n], is linear if:\n\nFor every 1 < j <= k, prices[indexes[j]] - prices[indexes[j - 1]] == indexes[j] - indexes[j - 1].\n\nA subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\nThe score of a selection indexes, is equal to the sum of the following array: [prices[indexes[1]], prices[indexes[2]], ..., prices[indexes[k]].\nReturn the maximum score that a linear selection can have.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [1,5,3,7,8]\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: We can select the indexes [2,4,5]. We show that our selection is linear:\nFor j = 2, we have:\nindexes[2] - indexes[1] = 4 - 2 = 2.\nprices[4] - prices[2] = 7 - 5 = 2.\nFor j = 3, we have:\nindexes[3] - indexes[2] = 5 - 4 = 1.\nprices[5] - prices[4] = 8 - 7 = 1.\nThe sum of the elements is: prices[2] + prices[4] + prices[5] = 20.\nIt can be shown that the maximum sum a linear selection can have is 20.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [5,6,7,8,9]\nOutput: 35\nExplanation: We can select all of the indexes [1,2,3,4,5]. Since each element has a difference of exactly 1 from its previous element, our selection is linear.\nThe sum of all the elements is 35 which is the maximum possible some out of every selection.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= prices.length <= 105\n1 <= prices[i] <= 109\n\n",

  "description": "You are given an integer array nums of size n where n is a multiple of 3 and a positive integer k.\nDivide the array nums into n / 3 arrays of size 3 satisfying the following condition:\n\nThe difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.\n\nReturn a 2D array containing the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2\nOutput: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]\nExplanation:\nThe difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,4,2,2,5,2], k = 2\nOutput: []\nExplanation:\nDifferent ways to divide nums into 2 arrays of size 3 are:\n\n[[2,2,2],[2,4,5]] (and its permutations)\n[[2,2,4],[2,2,5]] (and its permutations)\n\nBecause there are four 2s there will be an array with the elements 2 and 5 no matter how we divide it. since 5 - 2 = 3 > k, the condition is not satisfied and so there is no valid division.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [4,2,9,8,2,12,7,12,10,5,8,5,5,7,9,2,5,11], k = 14\nOutput: [[2,2,12],[4,8,5],[5,9,7],[7,8,5],[5,9,10],[11,12,2]]\nExplanation:\nThe difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 14.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n1 <= n <= 105\nn is a multiple of 3\n1 <= nums[i] <= 105\n1 <= k <= 105\n\n",

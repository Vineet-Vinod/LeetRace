  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the sum of all its cousins' values.\nTwo nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth with different parents.\nReturn the root of the modified tree.\nNote that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path from the root node to it.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [5,4,9,1,10,null,7]\nOutput: [0,0,0,7,7,null,11]\nExplanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.\n- Node with value 5 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.\n- Node with value 4 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.\n- Node with value 9 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.\n- Node with value 1 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.\n- Node with value 10 has a cousin with value 7 so its sum is 7.\n- Node with value 7 has cousins with values 1 and 10 so its sum is 11.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,1,2]\nOutput: [0,0,0]\nExplanation: The diagram above shows the initial binary tree and the binary tree after changing the value of each node.\n- Node with value 3 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.\n- Node with value 1 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.\n- Node with value 2 does not have any cousins so its sum is 0.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].\n1 <= Node.val <= 104\n\n",

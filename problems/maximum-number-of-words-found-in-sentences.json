  "description": "A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space\u00a0with no leading or trailing spaces.\nYou are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.\nReturn the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: sentences = [\"alice and bob love leetcode\", \"i think so too\", \"this is great thanks very much\"]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: \n- The first sentence, \"alice and bob love leetcode\", has 5 words in total.\n- The second sentence, \"i think so too\", has 4 words in total.\n- The third sentence, \"this is great thanks very much\", has 6 words in total.\nThus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: sentences = [\"please wait\", \"continue to fight\", \"continue to win\"]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. \nIn this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= sentences.length <= 100\n1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100\nsentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.\nsentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.\nAll the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.\n\n",

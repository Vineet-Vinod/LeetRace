  "description": "Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.\nThe cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.\nReturn a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.\nNote that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: tree = [7], target =  7\nOutput: 7\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4\nOutput: 4\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\nThe values of the nodes of the tree are unique.\ntarget node is a node from the original tree and is not null.\n\n\u00a0\nFollow up: Could you solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed?\n",

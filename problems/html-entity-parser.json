  "description": "HTML entity parser is the parser that takes HTML code as input and replace all the entities of the special characters by the characters itself.\nThe special characters and their entities for HTML are:\n\nQuotation Mark: the entity is &quot; and symbol character is \".\nSingle Quote Mark: the entity is &apos; and symbol character is '.\nAmpersand: the entity is &amp; and symbol character is &.\nGreater Than Sign: the entity is &gt; and symbol character is >.\nLess Than Sign: the entity is &lt; and symbol character is <.\nSlash: the entity is &frasl; and symbol character is /.\n\nGiven the input text string to the HTML parser, you have to implement the entity parser.\nReturn the text after replacing the entities by the special characters.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: text = \"&amp; is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not.\"\nOutput: \"& is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not.\"\nExplanation: The parser will replace the &amp; entity by &\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: text = \"and I quote: &quot;...&quot;\"\nOutput: \"and I quote: \\\"...\\\"\"\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= text.length <= 105\nThe string may contain any possible characters out of all the 256 ASCII characters.\n\n",

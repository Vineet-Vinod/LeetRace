  "description": "You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).\nAdditionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.\nGiven the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nWe can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:\n- Give the magical pill to worker 0.\n- Assign worker 0 to task 2 (0 + 1 >= 1)\n- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (3 >= 2)\n- Assign worker 2 to task 0 (3 >= 3)\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: tasks = [5,4], workers = [0,0,0], pills = 1, strength = 5\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nWe can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:\n- Give the magical pill to worker 0.\n- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 5 >= 5)\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: tasks = [10,15,30], workers = [0,10,10,10,10], pills = 3, strength = 10\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nWe can assign the magical pills and tasks as follows:\n- Give the magical pill to worker 0 and worker 1.\n- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 10 >= 10)\n- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (10 + 10 >= 15)\nThe last pill is not given because it will not make any worker strong enough for the last task.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == tasks.length\nm == workers.length\n1 <= n, m <= 5 * 104\n0 <= pills <= m\n0 <= tasks[i], workers[j], strength <= 109\n\n",

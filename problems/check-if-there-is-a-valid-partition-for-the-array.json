  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. You have to partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays.\nWe call a partition of the array valid if each of the obtained subarrays satisfies one of the following conditions:\n\nThe subarray consists of exactly 2, equal elements. For example, the subarray [2,2] is good.\nThe subarray consists of exactly 3, equal elements. For example, the subarray [4,4,4] is good.\nThe subarray consists of exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements, that is, the difference between adjacent elements is 1. For example, the subarray [3,4,5] is good, but the subarray [1,3,5] is not.\n\nReturn true if the array has at least one valid partition. Otherwise, return false.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [4,4,4,5,6]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The array can be partitioned into the subarrays [4,4] and [4,5,6].\nThis partition is valid, so we return true.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,2]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There is no valid partition for this array.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 106\n\n",

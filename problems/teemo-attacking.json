  "description": "Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.\nYou are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.\nReturn the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:\n- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.\n- At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.\nAshe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:\n- At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.\n- At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.\nAshe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= timeSeries.length <= 104\n0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 107\ntimeSeries is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n",

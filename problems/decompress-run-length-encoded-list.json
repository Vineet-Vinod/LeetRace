Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.\nReturn the decompressed list.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [2,4,4,4]\nExplanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].\nThe second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].\nAt the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,2,3]\nOutput: [1,3,3]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 100\nnums.length % 2 == 0\n1 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n",

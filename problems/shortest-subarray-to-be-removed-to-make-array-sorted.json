  "description": "Given an integer array arr, remove a subarray (can be empty) from arr such that the remaining elements in arr are non-decreasing.\nReturn the length of the shortest subarray to remove.\nA subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.\nAnother correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The array is already non-decreasing. We do not need to remove any elements.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 105\n0 <= arr[i] <= 109\n\n",

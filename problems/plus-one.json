The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.\nIncrement the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: digits = [1,2,3]\nOutput: [1,2,4]\nExplanation: The array represents the integer 123.\nIncrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.\nThus, the result should be [1,2,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: digits = [4,3,2,1]\nOutput: [4,3,2,2]\nExplanation: The array represents the integer 4321.\nIncrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.\nThus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: digits = [9]\nOutput: [1,0]\nExplanation: The array represents the integer 9.\nIncrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.\nThus, the result should be [1,0].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= digits.length <= 100\n0 <= digits[i] <= 9\ndigits does not contain any leading 0's.\n\n",

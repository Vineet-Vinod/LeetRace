  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.\nReturn a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1\nOutput: [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nExplanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.\n- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.\n- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.\n- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.\n- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.\n- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.\n- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.\n- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.\nThus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order. \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2\nOutput: [0,1,2,3,4]\nExplanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. \nHence, we return [0,1,2,3,4].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n1 <= nums[i] <= 1000\nkey is an integer from the array nums.\n1 <= k <= nums.length\n\n",

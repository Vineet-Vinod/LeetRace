After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.\nReturn the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nSplitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.\nFor example, splitting into [5, 4], [3, 2, 1] will result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3], which isn't sorted.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nWe can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].\nHowever, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= arr.length <= 2000\n0 <= arr[i] <= 108\n\n",

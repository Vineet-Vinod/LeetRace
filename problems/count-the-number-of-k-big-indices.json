There are three valid idx2: 2, 3, and 4.\n- i = 3 --> There are two valid idx1: 0 and 1. There are two valid idx2: 3 and 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1], k = 3\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no 3-big indices in nums.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i], k <= nums.length\n\n",

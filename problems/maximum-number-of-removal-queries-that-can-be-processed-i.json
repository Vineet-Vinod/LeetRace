  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array nums and a 0-indexed array queries.\nYou can do the following operation at the beginning at most once:\n\nReplace nums with a subsequence of nums.\n\nWe start processing queries in the given order; for each query, we do the following:\n\nIf the first and the last element of nums is less than queries[i], the processing of queries ends.\nOtherwise, we choose either the first or the last element of nums if it is greater than or equal to queries[i], and we remove the chosen element from nums.\n\nReturn the maximum number of queries that can be processed by doing the operation optimally.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], queries = [1,2,3,4,6]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We don't do any operation and process the queries as follows:\n1- We choose and remove nums[0] since 1 <= 1, then nums becomes [2,3,4,5].\n2- We choose and remove nums[0] since 2 <= 2, then nums becomes [3,4,5].\n3- We choose and remove nums[0] since 3 <= 3, then nums becomes [4,5].\n4- We choose and remove nums[0] since 4 <= 4, then nums becomes [5].\n5- We can not choose any elements from nums since they are not greater than or equal to 5.\nHence, the answer is 4.\nIt can be shown that we can't process more than 4 queries.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,3,2], queries = [2,2,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We don't do any operation and process the queries as follows:\n1- We choose and remove nums[0] since 2 <= 2, then nums becomes [3,2].\n2- We choose and remove nums[1] since 2 <= 2, then nums becomes [3].\n3- We choose and remove nums[0] since 3 <= 3, then nums becomes [].\nHence, the answer is 3.\nIt can be shown that we can't process more than 3 queries.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,3], queries = [4,3,2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: First we replace nums with the subsequence of nums [4,3].\nThen we can process the queries as follows:\n1- We choose and remove nums[0] since 4 <= 4, then nums becomes [3].\n2- We choose and remove nums[0] since 3 <= 3, then nums becomes [].\n3- We can not process any more queries since nums is empty.\nHence, the answer is 2.\nIt can be shown that we can't process more than 2 queries.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n1 <= queries.length <= 1000\n1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 109\n\n",

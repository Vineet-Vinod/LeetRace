  "description": "You are given an even number of people numPeople that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else so that there are numPeople / 2 handshakes total.\nReturn the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.\nSince the answer could be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: numPeople = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are two ways to do it, the first way is [(1,2),(3,4)] and the second one is [(2,3),(4,1)].\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: numPeople = 6\nOutput: 5\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= numPeople <= 1000\nnumPeople is even.\n\n",

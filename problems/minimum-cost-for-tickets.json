  "description": "You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.\nTrain tickets are sold in three different ways:\n\na 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,\na 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and\na 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.\n\nThe passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.\n\nFor example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\nReturn the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]\nOutput: 11\nExplanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:\nOn day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.\nOn day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.\nOn day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.\nIn total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]\nOutput: 17\nExplanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:\nOn day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.\nOn day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.\nIn total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= days.length <= 365\n1 <= days[i] <= 365\ndays is in strictly increasing order.\ncosts.length == 3\n1 <= costs[i] <= 1000\n\n",

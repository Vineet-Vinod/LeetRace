In the game, Alice can choose either all single-digit numbers or all double-digit numbers from nums, and the rest of the numbers are given to Bob. Alice wins if the sum of her numbers is strictly greater than the sum of Bob's numbers.\nReturn true if Alice can win this game, otherwise, return false.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,10]\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nAlice cannot win by choosing either single-digit or double-digit numbers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,14]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nAlice can win by choosing single-digit numbers which have a sum equal to 15.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [5,5,5,25]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nAlice can win by choosing double-digit numbers which have a sum equal to 25.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= nums[i] <= 99\n\n",

  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.\nReturn a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,3],[2,2]]\nOutput: [2,4]\nExplanation: Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]]\nOutput: [9,5]\nExplanation: Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50\n1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n\nFor all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is not equal to any of the grid members.\nFor all x that 1 <= x <= n * n there is exactly one x that is equal to exactly two of the grid members.\nFor all x that 1 <= x <= n * n except two of them there is exactly one pair of i, j that 0 <= i, j <= n - 1 and grid[i][j] == x.\n\n",

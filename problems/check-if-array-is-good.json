  "description": "You are given an integer array nums. We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].\nbase[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].\nReturn true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.\nNote: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 1, 3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1, 1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 4:\n\nInput: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 100\n1 <= num[i] <= 200\n\n",

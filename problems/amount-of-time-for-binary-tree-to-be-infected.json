  "description": "You are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and an integer start. At minute 0, an infection starts from the node with value start.\nEach minute, a node becomes infected if:\n\nThe node is currently uninfected.\nThe node is adjacent to an infected node.\n\nReturn the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,5,3,null,4,10,6,9,2], start = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The following nodes are infected during:\n- Minute 0: Node 3\n- Minute 1: Nodes 1, 10 and 6\n- Minute 2: Node 5\n- Minute 3: Node 4\n- Minute 4: Nodes 9 and 2\nIt takes 4 minutes for the whole tree to be infected so we return 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [1], start = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: At minute 0, the only node in the tree is infected so we return 0.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].\n1 <= Node.val <= 105\nEach node has a unique value.\nA node with a value of start exists in the tree.\n\n",

  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing positive integers.\nYour task is to minimize the length of nums by performing the following operations any number of times (including zero):\n\nSelect two distinct indices i and j from nums, such that nums[i] > 0 and nums[j] > 0.\nInsert the result of nums[i] % nums[j] at the end of nums.\nDelete the elements at indices i and j from nums.\n\nReturn an integer denoting the minimum length of nums after performing the operation any number of times.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,4,3,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows:\nOperation 1: Select indices 2 and 1, insert nums[2] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [1,4,3,1,3], then delete elements at indices 2 and 1.\nnums becomes [1,1,3].\nOperation 2: Select indices 1 and 2, insert nums[1] % nums[2] at the end and it becomes [1,1,3,1], then delete elements at indices 1 and 2.\nnums becomes [1,1].\nOperation 3: Select indices 1 and 0, insert nums[1] % nums[0] at the end and it becomes [1,1,0], then delete elements at indices 1 and 0.\nnums becomes [0].\nThe length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 1.\nIt can be shown that 1 is the minimum achievable length. \nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,5,5,10,5]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows:\nOperation 1: Select indices 0 and 3, insert nums[0] % nums[3] at the end and it becomes [5,5,5,10,5,5], then delete elements at indices 0 and 3.\nnums becomes [5,5,5,5]. \nOperation 2: Select indices 2 and 3, insert nums[2] % nums[3] at the end and it becomes [5,5,5,5,0], then delete elements at indices 2 and 3. \nnums becomes [5,5,0]. \nOperation 3: Select indices 0 and 1, insert nums[0] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [5,5,0,0], then delete elements at indices 0 and 1.\nnums becomes [0,0].\nThe length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 2.\nIt can be shown that 2 is the minimum achievable length. \nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [2,3,4]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows: \nOperation 1: Select indices 1 and 2, insert nums[1] % nums[2] at the end and it becomes [2,3,4,3], then delete elements at indices 1 and 2.\nnums becomes [2,3].\nOperation 2: Select indices 1 and 0, insert nums[1] % nums[0] at the end and it becomes [2,3,1], then delete elements at indices 1 and 0.\nnums becomes [1].\nThe length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 1.\nIt can be shown that 1 is the minimum achievable length.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n",

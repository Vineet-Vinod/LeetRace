  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a positive integer x.\nYou are initially at position 0 in the array and you can visit other positions according to the following rules:\n\nIf you are currently in position i, then you can move to any position j such that i < j.\nFor each position i that you visit, you get a score of nums[i].\nIf you move from a position i to a position j and the parities of nums[i] and nums[j] differ, then you lose a score of x.\n\nReturn the maximum total score you can get.\nNote that initially you have nums[0] points.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,3,6,1,9,2], x = 5\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: We can visit the following positions in the array: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\nThe corresponding values are 2, 6, 1 and 9. Since the integers 6 and 1 have different parities, the move 2 -> 3 will make you lose a score of x = 5.\nThe total score will be: 2 + 6 + 1 + 9 - 5 = 13.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,4,6,8], x = 3\nOutput: 20\nExplanation: All the integers in the array have the same parities, so we can visit all of them without losing any score.\nThe total score is: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i], x <= 106\n\n",

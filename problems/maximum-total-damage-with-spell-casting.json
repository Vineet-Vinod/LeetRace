Multiple spells can have the same damage value.\nIt is a known fact that if a magician decides to cast a spell with a damage of power[i], they cannot cast any spell with a damage of power[i] - 2, power[i] - 1, power[i] + 1, or power[i] + 2.\nEach spell can be cast only once.\nReturn the maximum possible total damage that a magician can cast.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: power = [1,1,3,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nThe maximum possible damage of 6 is produced by casting spells 0, 1, 3 with damage 1, 1, 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: power = [7,1,6,6]\nOutput: 13\nExplanation:\nThe maximum possible damage of 13 is produced by casting spells 1, 2, 3 with damage 1, 6, 6.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= power.length <= 105\n1 <= power[i] <= 109\n\n",

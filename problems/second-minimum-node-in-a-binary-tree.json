  "description": "Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property\u00a0root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)\u00a0always holds.\nGiven such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.\nIf no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [2,2,5,null,null,5,7]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [2,2,2]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 25].\n1 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1\nroot.val == min(root.left.val, root.right.val)\u00a0for each internal node of the tree.\n\n",

  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums.\nA subarray of nums is called incremovable if nums becomes strictly increasing on removing the subarray. For example, the subarray [3, 4] is an incremovable subarray of [5, 3, 4, 6, 7] because removing this subarray changes the array [5, 3, 4, 6, 7] to [5, 6, 7] which is strictly increasing.\nReturn the total number of incremovable subarrays of nums.\nNote that an empty array is considered strictly increasing.\nA subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: The 10 incremovable subarrays are: [1], [2], [3], [4], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [1,2,3,4], because on removing any one of these subarrays nums becomes strictly increasing. Note that you cannot select an empty subarray.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [6,5,7,8]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The 7 incremovable subarrays are: [5], [6], [5,7], [6,5], [5,7,8], [6,5,7] and [6,5,7,8].\nIt can be shown that there are only 7 incremovable subarrays in nums.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [8,7,6,6]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The 3 incremovable subarrays are: [8,7,6], [7,6,6], and [8,7,6,6]. Note that [8,7] is not an incremovable subarray because after removing [8,7] nums becomes [6,6], which is sorted in ascending order but not strictly increasing.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n",

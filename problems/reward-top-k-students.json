  "description": "You are given two string arrays positive_feedback and negative_feedback, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that no word is both positive and negative.\nInitially every student has 0 points. Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3, whereas each negative word decreases the points by 1.\nYou are given n feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array report\u00a0and a 0-indexed integer array student_id, where student_id[i] represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report report[i]. The ID of each student is unique.\nGiven an integer k, return the top k students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: positive_feedback = [\"smart\",\"brilliant\",\"studious\"], negative_feedback = [\"not\"], report = [\"this student is studious\",\"the student is smart\"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: \nBoth the students have 1 positive feedback and 3 points but since student 1 has a lower ID he ranks higher.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: positive_feedback = [\"smart\",\"brilliant\",\"studious\"], negative_feedback = [\"not\"], report = [\"this student is not studious\",\"the student is smart\"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2\nOutput: [2,1]\nExplanation: \n- The student with ID 1 has 1 positive feedback and 1 negative feedback, so he has 3-1=2 points. \n- The student with ID 2 has 1 positive feedback, so he has 3 points. \nSince student 2 has more points, [2,1] is returned.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= positive_feedback.length, negative_feedback.length <= 104\n1 <= positive_feedback[i].length, negative_feedback[j].length <= 100\nBoth positive_feedback[i] and negative_feedback[j] consists of lowercase English letters.\nNo word is present in both positive_feedback and negative_feedback.\nn == report.length == student_id.length\n1 <= n <= 104\nreport[i] consists of lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.\nThere is a single space between consecutive words of report[i].\n1 <= report[i].length <= 100\n1 <= student_id[i] <= 109\nAll the values of student_id[i] are unique.\n1 <= k <= n\n\n",

  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree where every node has a unique value and a target integer k, return the value of the nearest leaf node to the target k in the tree.\nNearest to a leaf means the least number of edges traveled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,3,2], k = 1\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [1], k = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].\n1 <= Node.val <= 1000\nAll the values of the tree are unique.\nThere exist some node in the tree where Node.val == k.\n\n",

  "description": "There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).\nPrior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].\nGiven the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.\nYou must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0\nOutput: 4\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3\nOutput: -1\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [1], target = 0\nOutput: -1\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 5000\n-104 <= nums[i] <= 104\nAll values of nums are unique.\nnums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.\n-104 <= target <= 104\n\n",

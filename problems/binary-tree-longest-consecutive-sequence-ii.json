This path can be either increasing or decreasing.\n\nFor example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [2,1,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].\n-3 * 104 <= Node.val <= 3 * 104\n\n",

  "description": "You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.\nReturn the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: cards = [1,0,5,3]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= cards.length <= 105\n0 <= cards[i] <= 106\n\n",

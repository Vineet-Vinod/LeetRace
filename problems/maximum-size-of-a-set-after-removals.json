  "description": "You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of even length n.\nYou must remove n / 2 elements from nums1 and n / 2 elements from nums2. After the removals, you insert the remaining elements of nums1 and nums2 into a set s.\nReturn the maximum possible size of the set s.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,1,2], nums2 = [1,1,1,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We remove two occurences of 1 from nums1 and nums2. After the removals, the arrays become equal to nums1 = [2,2] and nums2 = [1,1]. Therefore, s = {1,2}.\nIt can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible size of the set s after the removals.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6], nums2 = [2,3,2,3,2,3]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: We remove 2, 3, and 6 from nums1, as well as 2 and two occurrences of 3 from nums2. After the removals, the arrays become equal to nums1 = [1,4,5] and nums2 = [2,3,2]. Therefore, s = {1,2,3,4,5}.\nIt can be shown that 5 is the maximum possible size of the set s after the removals.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums1 = [1,1,2,2,3,3], nums2 = [4,4,5,5,6,6]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: We remove 1, 2, and 3 from nums1, as well as 4, 5, and 6 from nums2. After the removals, the arrays become equal to nums1 = [1,2,3] and nums2 = [4,5,6]. Therefore, s = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.\nIt can be shown that 6 is the maximum possible size of the set s after the removals.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums1.length == nums2.length\n1 <= n <= 2 * 104\nn is even.\n1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109\n\n",

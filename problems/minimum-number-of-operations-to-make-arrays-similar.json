  "description": "You are given two positive integer arrays nums and target, of the same length.\nIn one operation, you can choose any two distinct indices i and j where 0 <= i, j < nums.length and:\n\nset nums[i] = nums[i] + 2 and\nset nums[j] = nums[j] - 2.\n\nTwo arrays are considered to be similar if the frequency of each element is the same.\nReturn the minimum number of operations required to make nums similar to target. The test cases are generated such that nums can always be similar to target.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,12,6], target = [2,14,10]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: It is possible to make nums similar to target in two operations:\n- Choose i = 0 and j = 2, nums = [10,12,4].\n- Choose i = 1 and j = 2, nums = [10,14,2].\nIt can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations needed.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,5], target = [4,1,3]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can make nums similar to target in one operation:\n- Choose i = 1 and j = 2, nums = [1,4,3].\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = [1,1,1,1,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The array nums is already similiar to target.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length == target.length\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 106\nIt is possible to make nums similar to target.\n\n",

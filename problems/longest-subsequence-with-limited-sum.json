  "description": "You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.\nReturn an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].\nA subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]\nOutput: [2,3,4]\nExplanation: We answer the queries as follows:\n- The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.\n- The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.\n- The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]\nOutput: [0]\nExplanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer[0] = 0.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\nm == queries.length\n1 <= n, m <= 1000\n1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 106\n\n",

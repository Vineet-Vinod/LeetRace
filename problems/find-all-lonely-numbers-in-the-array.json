  "description": "You are given an integer array nums. A number x is lonely when it appears only once, and no adjacent numbers (i.e. x + 1 and x - 1) appear in the array.\nReturn all lonely numbers in nums. You may return the answer in any order.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [10,6,5,8]\nOutput: [10,8]\nExplanation: \n- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.\n- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.\n- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.\nHence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].\nNote that [8, 10] may also be returned.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,5,3]\nOutput: [1,5]\nExplanation: \n- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums.\n- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums.\n- 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice.\nHence, the lonely numbers in nums are [1, 5].\nNote that [5, 1] may also be returned.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= nums[i] <= 106\n\n",

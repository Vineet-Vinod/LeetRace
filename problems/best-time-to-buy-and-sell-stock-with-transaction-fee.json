  "description": "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.\nFind the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.\nNote:\n\nYou may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\nThe transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:\n- Buying at prices[0] = 1\n- Selling at prices[3] = 8\n- Buying at prices[4] = 4\n- Selling at prices[5] = 9\nThe total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3\nOutput: 6\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104\n1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104\n0 <= fee < 5 * 104\n\n",

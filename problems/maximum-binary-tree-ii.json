  "description": "A maximum tree is a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.\nYou are given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer val.\nJust as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from a list a (root = Construct(a)) recursively with the following Construct(a) routine:\n\nIf a is empty, return null.\nOtherwise, let a[i] be the largest element of a. Create a root node with the value a[i].\nThe left child of root will be Construct([a[0], a[1], ..., a[i - 1]]).\nThe right child of root will be Construct([a[i + 1], a[i + 2], ..., a[a.length - 1]]).\nReturn root.\n\nNote that we were not given a directly, only a root node root = Construct(a).\nSuppose b is a copy of a with the value val appended to it. It is guaranteed that b has unique values.\nReturn Construct(b).\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5\nOutput: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]\nExplanation: a = [1,4,2,3], b = [1,4,2,3,5]\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3\nOutput: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]\nExplanation: a = [2,1,5,4], b = [2,1,5,4,3]\n\nExample 3:\n\n\nInput: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4\nOutput: [5,2,4,null,1,3]\nExplanation: a = [2,1,5,3], b = [2,1,5,3,4]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].\n1 <= Node.val <= 100\nAll the values of the tree are unique.\n1 <= val <= 100\n\n",

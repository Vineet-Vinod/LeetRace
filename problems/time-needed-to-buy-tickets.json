  "description": "There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.\nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].\nEach person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.\nReturn the time taken for the person initially at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\n\nThe queue starts as [2,3,2], where the kth person is underlined.\nAfter the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [3,2,1] at 1 second.\nContinuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1,2] at 2 seconds.\nContinuing this process, the queue becomes [1,2,1] at 3 seconds.\nContinuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1] at 4 seconds. Note: the person at the front left the queue.\nContinuing this process, the queue becomes [1,1] at 5 seconds.\nContinuing this process, the queue becomes [1] at 6 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:\n\nThe queue starts as [5,1,1,1], where the kth person is underlined.\nAfter the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [1,1,1,4] at 1 second.\nContinuing this process for 3 seconds, the queue becomes [4] at 4 seconds.\nContinuing this process for 4 seconds, the queue becomes [] at 8 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 8.\n\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == tickets.length\n1 <= n <= 100\n1 <= tickets[i] <= 100\n0 <= k < n\n\n",

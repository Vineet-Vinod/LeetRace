The game's score is the sum of the indices of the players who touched the ball, including repetitions, i.e. i + receiver[i] + receiver[receiver[i]] + ... + receiver(k)[i].\nReturn\u00a0the maximum\u00a0possible score.\nNotes:\n\nreceiver may contain duplicates.\nreceiver[i] may be equal to i.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: receiver = [2,0,1], k = 4\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nStarting with player i = 2 the initial score is 2:\n\n\n\nPass\nSender Index\nReceiver Index\nScore\n\n\n1\n2\n1\n3\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n3\n\n\n3\n0\n2\n5\n\n\n4\n2\n1\n6\n\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: receiver = [1,1,1,2,3], k = 3\nOutput: 10\nExplanation:\nStarting with player i = 4 the initial score is 4:\n\n\n\nPass\nSender Index\nReceiver Index\nScore\n\n\n1\n4\n3\n7\n\n\n2\n3\n2\n9\n\n\n3\n2\n1\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= receiver.length == n <= 105\n0 <= receiver[i] <= n - 1\n1 <= k <= 1010\n\n",

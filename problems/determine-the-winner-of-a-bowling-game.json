  "description": "You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays player1 and player2, representing the number of pins that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.\nThe bowling game consists of n turns, and the number of pins in each turn is exactly 10.\nAssume a player hits xi pins in the ith turn. The value of the ith turn for the player is:\n\n2xi if the player hits 10 pins in either (i - 1)th or (i - 2)th turn.\nOtherwise, it is xi.\n\nThe score of the player is the sum of the values of their n turns.\nReturn\n\n1 if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,\n2 if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and\n0 in case of a draw.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: player1 = [5,10,3,2], player2 = [6,5,7,3]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nThe score of player 1 is 5 + 10 + 2*3 + 2*2 = 25.\nThe score of player 2 is 6 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 21.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nThe score of player 1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.\nThe score of player 2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: player1 = [2,3], player2 = [4,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThe score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5.\nThe score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: player1 = [1,1,1,10,10,10,10], player2 = [10,10,10,10,1,1,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nThe score of player1 is 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 73.\nThe score of player2 is 10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 1 = 75.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nn == player1.length == player2.length\n1 <= n <= 1000\n0 <= player1[i], player2[i] <= 10\n\n",

The answer array should be of the same length as nums, where each element answer[i] represents the maximum Hamming distance between nums[i] and any other element nums[j] in the array.\nThe Hamming distance between two binary integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits differ (add leading zeroes if needed).\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [9,12,9,11], m = 4\nOutput: [2,3,2,3]\nExplanation:\nThe binary representation of nums = [1001,1100,1001,1011].\nThe maximum hamming distances for each index are:\n\nnums[0]: 1001 and 1100 have a distance of 2.\nnums[1]: 1100 and 1011 have a distance of 3.\nnums[2]: 1001 and 1100 have a distance of 2.\nnums[3]: 1011 and 1100 have a distance of 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,6,10], m = 4\nOutput: [3,3,2,3]\nExplanation:\nThe binary representation of nums = [0011,0100,0110,1010].\nThe maximum hamming distances for each index are:\n\nnums[0]: 0011 and 0100 have a distance of 3.\nnums[1]: 0100 and 0011 have a distance of 3.\nnums[2]: 0110 and 1010 have a distance of 2.\nnums[3]: 1010 and 0100 have a distance of 3.\n\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= m <= 17\n2 <= nums.length <= 2m\n0 <= nums[i] < 2m\n\n",

  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array tasks, where tasks[i] represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level.\nReturn the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:\n- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. \n- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. \n- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. \n- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  \nIt can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: tasks = [2,3,3]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= tasks.length <= 105\n1 <= tasks[i] <= 109\n\n\u00a0\nNote: This question is the same as 2870: Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty.\n",

So return 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: \nThe degree is 3 because the element 2 is repeated 3 times.\nSo [2,2,3,1,4,2] is the shortest subarray, therefore returning 6.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nnums.length will be between 1 and 50,000.\nnums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.\n\n",

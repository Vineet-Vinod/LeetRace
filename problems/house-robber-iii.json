  "description": "The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.\nBesides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.\nGiven the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n0 <= Node.val <= 104\n\n",

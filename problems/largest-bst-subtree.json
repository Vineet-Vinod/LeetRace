  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest subtree, which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST), where the largest means subtree has the largest number of nodes.\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:\n\nThe left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) node's value.\nThe right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) node's value.\n\nNote: A subtree must include all of its descendants.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,7,2,3,5,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,1]\nOutput: 2\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n-104 <= Node.val <= 104\n\n\u00a0\nFollow up: Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?\n",

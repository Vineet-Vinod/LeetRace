Your mom wants you to share these candies with your little sister by giving her k consecutive candies, but you want to keep as many flavors of candies as possible.\nReturn the maximum number of unique flavors of candy you can keep after sharing  with your sister.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: candies = [1,2,2,3,4,3], k = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nGive the candies in the range [1, 3] (inclusive) with flavors [2,2,3].\nYou can eat candies with flavors [1,4,3].\nThere are 3 unique flavors, so return 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: candies = [2,2,2,2,3,3], k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nGive the candies in the range [3, 4] (inclusive) with flavors [2,3].\nYou can eat candies with flavors [2,2,2,3].\nThere are 2 unique flavors, so return 2.\nNote that you can also share the candies with flavors [2,2] and eat the candies with flavors [2,2,3,3].\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: candies = [2,4,5], k = 0\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nYou do not have to give any candies.\nYou can eat the candies with flavors [2,4,5].\nThere are 3 unique flavors, so return 3.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= candies.length <= 105\n1 <= candies[i] <= 105\n0 <= k <= candies.length\n\n",

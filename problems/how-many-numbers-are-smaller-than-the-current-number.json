That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's\u00a0such that\u00a0j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].\nReturn the answer in an array.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]\nOutput: [4,0,1,1,3]\nExplanation: \nFor nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). \nFor nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.\nFor nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). \nFor nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). \nFor nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [6,5,4,8]\nOutput: [2,1,0,3]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [7,7,7,7]\nOutput: [0,0,0,0]\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 500\n0 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n",

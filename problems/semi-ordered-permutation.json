  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed permutation of n integers nums.\nA permutation is called semi-ordered if the first number equals 1 and the last number equals n. You can perform the below operation as many times as you want until you make nums a semi-ordered permutation:\n\nPick two adjacent elements in nums, then swap them.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations to make nums a semi-ordered permutation.\nA permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length n containing each number exactly once.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,4,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations: \n1 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].\n2 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].\nIt can be proved that there is no sequence of less than two operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation. \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,4,1,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can make the permutation semi-ordered using these sequence of operations:\n1 - swap i = 1 and j = 2. The permutation becomes [2,1,4,3].\n2 - swap i = 0 and j = 1. The permutation becomes [1,2,4,3].\n3 - swap i = 2 and j = 3. The permutation becomes [1,2,3,4].\nIt can be proved that there is no sequence of less than three operations that make nums a semi-ordered permutation.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,4,2,5]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The permutation is already a semi-ordered permutation.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length == n <= 50\n1 <= nums[i]\u00a0<= 50\nnums is a permutation.\n\n",

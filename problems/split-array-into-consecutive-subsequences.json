(i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not).\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:\n[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3\n[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:\n[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 104\n-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000\nnums is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n",

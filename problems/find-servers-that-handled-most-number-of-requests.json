  "description": "You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:\n\nThe ith (0-indexed) request arrives.\nIf all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).\nIf the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.\nOtherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.\n\nYou are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.\nReturn a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] \nOutput: [1] \nExplanation: \nAll of the servers start out available.\nThe first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.\nRequest 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.\nRequest 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.\nServers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]\nOutput: [0]\nExplanation: \nThe first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.\nRequest 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.\nServer 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]\nOutput: [0,1,2]\nExplanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= 105\n1 <= arrival.length, load.length <= 105\narrival.length == load.length\n1 <= arrival[i], load[i] <= 109\narrival is strictly increasing.\n\n",

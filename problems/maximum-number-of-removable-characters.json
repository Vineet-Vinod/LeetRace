  "description": "You are given two strings s and p where p is a subsequence of s. You are also given a distinct 0-indexed integer array removable containing a subset of indices of s (s is also 0-indexed).\nYou want to choose an integer k (0 <= k <= removable.length) such that, after removing k characters from s using the first k indices in removable, p is still a subsequence of s. More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 <= i < k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.\nReturn the maximum k you can choose such that p is still a subsequence of s after the removals.\nA subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcacb\", p = \"ab\", removable = [3,1,0]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, \"abcacb\" becomes \"accb\".\n\"ab\" is a subsequence of \"accb\".\nIf we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0, \"abcacb\" becomes \"ccb\", and \"ab\" is no longer a subsequence.\nHence, the maximum k is 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcbddddd\", p = \"abcd\", removable = [3,2,1,4,5,6]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: After removing the character at index 3, \"abcbddddd\" becomes \"abcddddd\".\n\"abcd\" is a subsequence of \"abcddddd\".\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"abcab\", p = \"abc\", removable = [0,1,2,3,4]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: If you remove the first index in the array removable, \"abc\" is no longer a subsequence.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= p.length <= s.length <= 105\n0 <= removable.length < s.length\n0 <= removable[i] < s.length\np is a subsequence of s.\ns and p both consist of lowercase English letters.\nThe elements in removable are distinct.\n\n",

For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3.\nYou need to divide nums into 3 disjoint contiguous subarrays.\nReturn the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,12]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [1], [2], and [3,12] at a total cost of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\nThe other possible ways to form 3 subarrays are:\n- [1], [2,3], and [12] at a total cost of 1 + 2 + 12 = 15.\n- [1,2], [3], and [12] at a total cost of 1 + 3 + 12 = 16.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,4,3]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [5], [4], and [3] at a total cost of 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.\nIt can be shown that 12 is the minimum cost achievable.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [10,3,1,1]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [10,3], [1], and [1] at a total cost of 10 + 1 + 1 = 12.\nIt can be shown that 12 is the minimum cost achievable.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 50\n1 <= nums[i] <= 50\n\n",

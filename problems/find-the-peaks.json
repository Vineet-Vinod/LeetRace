  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array mountain. Your task is to find all the peaks in the mountain array.\nReturn an array that consists of indices of peaks in the given array in any order.\nNotes:\n\nA peak is defined as an element that is strictly greater than its neighboring elements.\nThe first and last elements of the array are not a peak.\n\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: mountain = [2,4,4]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: mountain[0] and mountain[2] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.\nmountain[1] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[2].\nSo the answer is [].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mountain = [1,4,3,8,5]\nOutput: [1,3]\nExplanation: mountain[0] and mountain[4] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.\nmountain[2] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[3] and mountain[1].\nBut mountain [1] and mountain[3] are strictly greater than their neighboring elements.\nSo the answer is [1,3].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= mountain.length <= 100\n1 <= mountain[i] <= 100\n\n",

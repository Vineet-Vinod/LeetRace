  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums whose length is a power of 2.\nApply the following algorithm on nums:\n\nLet n be the length of nums. If n == 1, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array newNums of length n / 2.\nFor every even index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).\nFor every odd index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).\nReplace the array nums with newNums.\nRepeat the entire process starting from step 1.\n\nReturn the last number that remains in nums after applying the algorithm.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,5,2,4,8,2,2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The following arrays are the results of applying the algorithm repeatedly.\nFirst: nums = [1,5,4,2]\nSecond: nums = [1,4]\nThird: nums = [1]\n1 is the last remaining number, so we return 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: 3 is already the last remaining number, so we return 3.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 1024\n1 <= nums[i] <= 109\nnums.length is a power of 2.\n\n",

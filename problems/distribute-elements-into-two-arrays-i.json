  "description": "You are given a 1-indexed array of distinct integers nums of length n.\nYou need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:\n\nIf the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2, append nums[i] to arr1. Otherwise, append nums[i] to arr2.\n\nThe array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].\nReturn the array result.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,3]\nOutput: [2,3,1]\nExplanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].\nIn the 3rd operation, as the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2 (2 > 1), append nums[3] to arr1.\nAfter 3 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1].\nHence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,4,3,8]\nOutput: [5,3,4,8]\nExplanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [5] and arr2 = [4].\nIn the 3rd operation, as the last element of arr1 is greater than the last element of arr2 (5 > 4), append nums[3] to arr1, hence arr1 becomes [5,3].\nIn the 4th operation, as the last element of arr2 is greater than the last element of arr1 (4 > 3), append nums[4] to arr2, hence arr2 becomes [4,8].\nAfter 4 operations, arr1 = [5,3] and arr2 = [4,8].\nHence, the array result formed by concatenation is [5,3,4,8].\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 50\n1 <= nums[i] <= 100\nAll elements in nums are distinct.\n\n",
